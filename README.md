This is a Rimworld mod, 
to add the ability to make a tea using commonly available plants that will reduce the negative effects of Luciferium.

Still under process but the idea is to, using daylilies or dandilions, mixed with smokeleaf plants, to brew a tea,
similar to Psychite tea, but is to reduce the withdrawl symptoms of psychite.

Simple usecase is if you are holding a prisonner with withdrawl symptoms, brew this tea and administer and they will no longer be suffering from addiction, and perhaps a little drowsy.
